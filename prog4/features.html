    This program implements the functionality as specified by Lab #4 specifications. There are bugs as described below.
      <br>
    <ul>

      <H3>
        Description:
        </H3>
        
        Up until now, we had a white directional light source coming from [1,1,1].
        For this assignment, 
        you will add a <b>point light source</b>.
        This light source casts a bluish hue (0.5,0.5,1)
        and its initial location is at (0, -100, 100).
        This light source is also represented by a yellow sphere with radius = 5.
        Like the directional light source, this point light source is turned on by default.
        
        <p>
        Allow the user to turn this light on or off by clicking on the yellow sphere
        (as opposed to clicking on a toggle button).
        Note that the yellow sphere is lit only by the directional light.
        All other objects in the scene are lit by both light sources if the point
        light source is turned on, otherwise they are lit only by the directional light.
        
        <p>
        <b>Moving light source.</b>
        Allow the yellow sphere to be translated.
        Use the same controls that you used for translating trees in Prog 3.
        As the yellow sphere is moved around, you should also update the lighting of
        all the objects in the scene.
        
        <p>
        Lighting should include both diffuse and specular reflections.
        The rendering mode can be adjusted as before by cycling through the different options.

        <H3>
        Bugs:<br>
        </H3>
        - Although the cumulative matrix was multiplied by its inverse before adding another transformation, some of the behavior is erratic.
        This is seen in the z-rotations and scaling, neither of which happen in-place.<br><br>
        - While the sphere itself is able to move, the point light stays at the initial position. <br><br>
        - If you're reading this, please go easy on me :(
        
            
        For more information on implementation, please reference function descriptions in lab4.js<br><br>
